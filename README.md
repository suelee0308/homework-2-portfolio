##About the project

1. Header section contains name and a nav bar. Nav bar buttons are on the right most side of the screen. Name is on the left most side. Header is responsive. Nav bar wraps below the header when screen shrinks. Nav bar buttons wrap even more when screen shrink. Nav bar links/buttons jump to their respective section in the screen. The last resume button opens a pdf in a new tab. 

2. Banner below the header contains a background image with a text box on top.

3. Main section of the webpage contains 3 sections that can all be accessed quickly from the navbar links.

4. Each section in the main has a left column that contains the title of the content of what appears in the right column. The left:right ratio is 3:7.

5. The first "About Me" section contains a paragraph.

6. The second "Portfolio" section contains 5 images with boxes that contain titles to what the images are links to. The first image/link is the largest. The 4 images below are in rows/columns of 2 until the screen shrinks to an iphone X size, which is when the images become the full width and stack on top of each other.

7. The third and final "Contact" section has 4 links that have a hover and focus effect and link to their respective address directions. 

##Obstacles/lessons
1. Position text/images to the right ratio and arrangement on the browser, which also needed to be responsive was the most difficult part of this assignment.

2. Trying to learn, unlearn, and the learn a different method of doing the same styling, and hence some rewriting of the html, to make code as concise as possible or for code to respond like I want it to.
